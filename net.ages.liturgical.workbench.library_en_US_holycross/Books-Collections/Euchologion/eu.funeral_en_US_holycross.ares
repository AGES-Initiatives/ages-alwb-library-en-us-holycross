Yea, O Lord our God, Who to Your holy Disciples and Apostles gave this authority for granting remission of sins, and did say that whatsoever things they would bind and loose, those things would be bound and would be loosed; and Who through them in Your man befriending love has caused to be transmitted to us also, unworthy though we be, the same gift in equal measure; loose this Your servant (Name), now fallen asleep from sin of soul and body, and make him (her) to be now forgiven in this present world and in the world to come;through the intercessions of Your all-pure and Ever Virgin Mother, and of all the Saints."
