Accept, immortal king, my repentance, that of a sinner, and turn towards me, and hear my words. I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned before heaven and before you, and I am not worthy to look upon the height of your glory, for I have provoked your goodness. I have transgressed your commandments. I have disobeyed your ordinances. But you, Lord, being long suffering, and of great mercy, do not remember evil, and have not given me over to destruction because of my lawlessness, but have ever awaited my conversion. You who love all people, said by your prophet, I do not desire the death of a sinner but that he should turn and live. For, Master, you do not wish that the work of your hands should perish, nor do you take pleasure in the destruction of human beings, but desire that everyone should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. Therefore, even I, although I am unworthy both of heaven and earth and of this temporary life, having wholly yielded myself to sin, and become the slave of pleasure and have defiled your image, yet being your creature and of your shaping, I do not despair for my salvation in my wretchedness. But I am emboldened by your infinite compassion and I draw near. Therefore, O Christ, you who love all people, receive even me as the harlot, as the thief, as the publican, as the prodigal. Take away the heavy burden of my sins, you who take away the sin of the world, who heal the infirmities of all people, who call to yourself the weary and burdened and give them rest, who came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. Do cleanse me from defilement of the flesh and spirit, and teach me to fulfill holiness in your fear, that in the pure testimony of my conscience, receiving my portion of your holy gifts, I may be united to your holy body and precious blood, and have you dwell and remain within me with the Father and your Holy Spirit. Yes, Lord Jesus Christ my God, grant that the communion of your holy and life giving mysteries may not be to my condemnation. Do not let me be afflicted in soul and body by partaking of them unworthily. But grant that to the last breath of my life I shall partake of my share uncondemned of your holy gifts, looking to the fellowship of the Holy Spirit for eternal life, and to a favorable answer at your awesome judgment seat, that even I may also become a partaker with your elect of your incorruptible blessings which you have prepared for those who love you and in whom, Lord, you are glorified to the ages of ages. Amen."

hoPCPrayer.Key021.text = "I know, Lord, that I partake unworthily of your pure body and precious blood, and that I am guilty, my Christ and my God, as I eat and drink condemnation to myself not discerning your body and blood. Yet, emboldened by your loving kindnesses, I come to you, who said, “he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood, abides in me and I in him.” Take pity, therefore, Lord, and do not rebuke me, a sinner, but deal with me mercifully. Let these holy gifts give me healing and cleansing, enlightenment and protection, salvation and sanctification of soul and body. May they avert every fantasy, evil practice, and operation of the devil enacted in my members by design. May they give me confidence in and love for you; amendment of life and perseverance, increase of virtue and perfection, fulfillment of your commandments, fellowship of the Holy Spirit, provisions for the journey of eternal life, and an acceptable answer at the awesome judgment seat. But let them not be for judgment or condemnation. Amen."

But as you humbled yourself from on high for our sake, do likewise also for my unworthiness. And as you willed in the cave to lie in a manger of dumb animals, take it upon yourself now to enter the manger of my dumb soul and into my soiled body. And as you did not refuse to enter and eat with sinners in the house of Simon the leper, so also deign to enter into the house of my soul, leper and sinner that I am. And as you did not cast out the harlot, a sinner like me, who came and touched you, so have compassion on me the sinner who now comes to touch you. And as you did not abhor the kiss of her sinful and unclean mouth, do not abhor my mouth, more stained and unclean than hers, nor my sordid and unclean and shameless lips, nor my more unclean tongue. But let the fiery coal of your most pure body and of your most precious blood bring sanctification, illumination, and strengthening of my lowly soul and body, relief of the burden of my many transgressions, protection against every operation of the devil, an averting and hindering of my mean and evil habits, mortification of my passions, fulfillment of your commandments, an increase of your divine grace, and inheritance of your kingdom. For it is not with a light heart, Christ my God, that I venture to approach you. But I trust in your ineffable goodness. May I not become prey to Satan by abstaining for long from your communion. Therefore, Lord, I pray to you who alone are holy that you sanctify my soul and body, my heart, and my mind, and renewing me wholly, implant in my members fear of you. Do not let your sanctification be taken from me, but be my help and protector, governing my life in peace. Make me worthy to obtain a place at your right hand with your saints, through the prayers and supplications of your most pure Mother, of your bodiless ministers and pure angelic powers, and of all your saints who from the ages have found favor in you. Amen."

Command that the gates open which you alone made and you will come in with love toward all people, as is your nature. You will come in and enlighten my darkened reasoning. I believe that you will do this, for you did not send away the harlot who came to you with tears, nor cast out the repenting publican, nor reject the thief who acknowledged your kingdom, nor forsake the repentant persecutor for what he was. But you counted as your friends all of those who came to you in repentance. You alone are blessed, always, now and to the endless ages. Amen."

And through the intercession of the all pure and ever virgin Mary, your Mother, who conceived you without sin, my only hope, protection, and salvation, count me worthy, uncondemned, to partake of your pure and immortal and life giving, awesome Mysteries, for the remission of sins, for eternal life, for sanctification and enlightenment, for strength, and healing and health of both soul and body, for the erasing and complete removal of my evil thoughts and recollections, superstitions and nocturnal phantasies brought by dark and evil spirits.

hoPCPrayer.Key071.title = "Seventh Prayer: Symeon The New Theologian"
hoPCPrayer.Key071.text = "From foul lips and impure heart, from unclean tongue and a defiled soul, receive my prayer, O my Christ. Take not into account my words, my ways, or my shamelessness. Grant me boldness, my Christ, to say all that I wish. But rather teach me all that I should do and say. I have sinned more than the harlot who, learning where you lived, boldly came forward to anoint your feet, O my Christ, my Master, and my God. And as you did not reject her to come with eagerness of heart, reject not me, O Word, but extend to me your feet that I may hold and kiss and with streams of tears, as with a precious myrrh, I may boldly anoint them. Wash me in my tears and purify me in them, O Word. Forgive my errors, and grant me pardon. You know the multitude of my sins, you also know my wounds and see my bruises. Yet you know my faith, you see my eagerness and hear my sighs. From you, my God, my Creator, and my Redeemer is hid not one tear, nor even a part of one. Your eyes know my imperfections; in your book already written down are all the acts yet not done. Behold my lowliness, behold how great is my weariness and all my sins. God of all, remit everything so that with a clean heart, a conscience filled with holy fear, and a contrite soul, I may partake of your most pure, and wholly spotless mysteries, that give life and divinity to all who eat and drink of you with a pure heart. For you have said, Master, that whoever eats my flesh and also drinks my blood, does indeed abide in me, and I in him. True indeed is the word of my Master and my God. For he who shares in these divine and deifying graces is in no way alone, but is with you, my Christ, the triple radiant light that enlightens the world. But so that I may never be alone without you, O Giver of life, my breath, my life, my joy, and the world's salvation, I have, as you see, with tears and a contrite soul drawn near to you to ransom my errors, beseeching you to rescue me and uncondemned to share in your life giving Mysteries. So as you have said you might dwell with me, the most wretched one, that I not be found by the deceiver, without your grace, and be seized by deception and seducing me lead me away from your life giving words. Therefore, I fall before you and fervently cry out to you: as you received the prodigal and the harlot when she came to you, so receive me, the harlot and prodigal, compassionate One, as I come to you now, with a contrite heart. I know Savior that no one has offended you as I have, nor committed the deeds that I have done. But this again I know, that neither the greatness of my sins nor the multitude of my transgressions exceed my God's great forbearance and his great love for all. But with the oil of forgiveness you cleanse and illumine those who fervently repent and make sharers of your light and partakers of your divinity. And although this is strange to the minds of angels and of men, you speak with them often as your true friends. These thoughts make me bold, these thoughts give me wings, my Christ, and seeing your rich kindness towards us, I rejoice and tremble too. I partake of fire, being grass, and behold, a strange wonder, I am unexpectedly refreshed as was the burning bush, burning but not consumed. Therefore, thankful in mind, thankful in heart, thankful in every member of my body and soul, I worship and magnify and glorify you, my God, as being blessed both now and to the ages."

In this assumed nature you underwent the life giving and saving passion: the cross, the nails, the spear death itself. Mortify in me the passions of the body that destroy the soul. You who destroyed the power of Hades by your burial, bury and destroy the devices of the evil spirits through pure thoughts. You who raised the fallen forefather by your resurrection, raise me up from the sin that I have fallen into and show me the way of repentance. By your glorious ascension you deified the assumed body and honored it at the right hand of the Father. Make me worthy, by partaking of your holy Mysteries, of a place at your right hand with the saved. You made your holy disciples precious vessels by the coming of the Comforter, the Spirit. Declare me also a vessel of your coming. You promised to come again to judge the world in righteousness. Grant that I shall go to meet you, my Creator and Maker, in the clouds, with all the saints, and that I may glorify you forever and praise you, with your eternal Father, and your all holy, gracious and life giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.
