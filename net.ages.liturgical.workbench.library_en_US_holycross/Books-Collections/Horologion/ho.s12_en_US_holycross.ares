Nail down our bodies with your fear, and deaden our earthly members, so that even in the quiet of our slumber we may be enlightened by the contemplation of your ordinances. Keep away from us every indecent fantasy and harmful desire. Awaken us in the time of prayer rooted in the faith, and thriving in your instructions; through the good will and goodness of your only-begotten Son with whom you are blessed, together with your all holy, good, and life giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages."

You, Lord, in the multitude of your goodness promised repentance and forgiveness to those who have sinned against you, and in your infinite compassion appointed repentance for sinners that they may be saved. Therefore, Lord, the God of the powers, you have not appointed repentance for the righteous, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who have not sinned against you, but you appointed repentance for me the sinner, for I have committed more sins than the grains of the sand of the sea. My transgressions have multiplied, Lord; my transgressions have multiplied, and I am not worthy to look up and see the height of the sky from the multitude of my iniquities, being weighted down by many iron chains, so that I cannot raise my head; there is no respite left for me because I provoked your anger and committed evil before you not having done your will and not having kept your commandments. And now I bend the knee of my heart, beseeching your goodness. I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned and I acknowledge my transgressions; but I beg and ask of you: Forgive me, Lord, forgive me and do not destroy me with my transgressions; do not be angry with me forever and keep my evils in me, and do not condemn me to the depths of the earth; for you are God, the God of those who repent, and in me you shall show all your goodness; for even though I am unworthy, you shall save me according to the multitude of your mercy, and I shall praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. For every heavenly power sings your praises, and yours is the glory unto the ages of ages."

But as the Mother of our compassionate God, and a friend of man, have compassion on me the sinner and prodigal, and accept this prayer from my impure lips; and using your motherly standing, entreat your Son and our Master and Lord to open unto me the depths of his loving goodness and, overlooking my innumerable faults, to return me to repentance and make me a worthy servant of his commandments. Stand by me forever; in this life as a merciful and compassionate and good and lovingly warm protector and helper, by repulsing the assaults of the adversary and leading me toward salvation; and at the time of my death, by embracing my miserable soul and driving far away from it the dark faces of the evil demons; and at the awesome day of judgment by redeeming me from eternal hell, and proclaiming me an heir of the ineffable glory of your Son and our God. May I enjoy such fate, my Lady, most-holy Theotokos, through your intercession and protection; through the grace and love for mankind of your only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Savior Jesus Christ. To whom belong all glory, honor and worship, together with his beginningless Father, and the all holy and good and life giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen."
